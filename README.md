📘 Expense Splitter & Expense Tracker (Beginner React Version)

A simple, beginner-friendly React Single Page Application (SPA) for tracking expenses and splitting costs among people.
No backend.
No database.
All data is stored locally using localStorage.

Perfect for learning React fundamentals like components, props, state (useState), conditional rendering, and organizing UI screens.

📝 1. Project Folder Structure
expence-spliter-management/
│
│ package.json
│ public/
│    index.html
│
└── src/
     index.js
     App.js
     style.css
     └── components/
           Navbar.js
           Home.js
           AddExpense.js
           ExpenseList.js
           Groups.js
           MonthlySummary.js

What each file does:

• public/index.html: Main HTML page. React mounts the whole app here.
• src/index.js: Starting point of the React app. Renders <App />.
• src/App.js: The main controller. Switches pages based on state.
• src/style.css: Custom styling (optional, small).
• src/components/: Each file is one screen of the app.

🎨 2. Why Bootstrap?

This project uses Bootstrap for styling because:

It looks clean without writing CSS

It gives ready-made forms, layouts, spacing, and buttons

Perfect for beginners who want to focus on logic instead of UI

Only one import needed:

import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";

⚛️ 3. What ReactDOM Does
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);


Simple explanation:

React looks for <div id="root"></div> in index.html

createRoot creates a space for React to draw the app

render(<App />) puts our whole React app inside that div

This is how React becomes visible inside the browser.

📥 4. Understanding Imports in App.js
import { useState } from "react";
import Navbar from "./components/Navbar";
import Home from "./components/Home";
import AddExpense from "./components/AddExpense";
import ExpenseList from "./components/ExpenseList";
import Groups from "./components/Groups";
import MonthlySummary from "./components/MonthlySummary";


Explanation:

useState helps us create variables that update the UI

every other import is a component (a UI screen)

App.js needs these to show them based on what the user clicks

🔁 5. Page Switching Logic (SPA)

In App.js:

{page === "home" && <Home />}
{page === "add-expense" && <AddExpense />}
{page === "expense-list" && <ExpenseList />}
{page === "groups" && <Groups />}
{page === "monthly-summary" && <MonthlySummary />}


Meaning:
"Show this component only if the page state matches its name."

This is how we create navigation without changing actual web pages.

📦 6. Why We Use useState()

useState() creates a special variable that:

stores data

updates the screen whenever the data changes

Example:

const [groups, setGroups] = useState([]);


Meaning:

groups holds the current list of groups

setGroups updates that list and refreshes the UI

Without useState, React wouldn't re-render when values change.

➕ 7. Example: Adding a Group
const addGroup = () => {
  if (!groupName.trim()) return;

  setGroups([...groups, groupName]);
  setGroupName("");
};


Explanation:

Prevent empty names

Add new group to old list using spread operator

Clear the input box

React redraws the updated list automatically

Where do setGroups and setGroupName come from?
From these lines:

const [groups, setGroups] = useState([]);
const [groupName, setGroupName] = useState("");

💾 8. Data Storage

No backend.
No MongoDB.
No APIs.

We use:

localStorage


This keeps data safe until the user clears the browser.
